# PLD-COMP

C compiler written in C++ using antlr4.

# Git conventions :

⇒ main : The branch with the stable version of the project (Only one person pushing on master)

⇒ dev : The branch where everyone can merge after finishing his feature (This is the branch on which we base ourselves to create a new branch)

⇒ `feat/feature_name` : In this branch only ONE functionality is developed

⇒ `fix/bug_name` : In this branch we fix a bug by mentioning the origin of the bug

⇒ `refact/refactor_name` : Improve the code without necessarily adding a feature

To merge on main ALWAYS create a pull request `main ← dev` (2 people validate before merge)
